Sample Bot Config.  This tells Chaskis where to connect to,
ane which channel to watch.

Notice the password in this field.  Don't be dumb and commit this file to a senstive area.
Copy/Paste this elsewhere if needed. Chaskis has command line arguments you can use to point
to that pasted file instead of having to use the one located in ApplicationData

The server and channel are required.  No field can be an empty string.  Port can not be negative.
Password is optional.
