Sample plugin config.  This includes the absolute path
to the plugin to use.  It also asks for the single class in
the assembly that implements IPlugin.  When Chaskis runs, it will
load in those plugins.  Note, if failOnBadPlugin=yes is passed into the program,
the program will terminate on a bad load, so make sure your path and class name are correct!

Typically plugins live in ApplicationData/Chaskis/plugins.

GenericIrcBot.dll is loaded automatically.
