<!--
    The config for caps watcher is very simple.  Each tag is something
    you want the bot to randomly say when someone says something that is in all caps.
    {%user%} is replaced with the offending user's nickname.
    
    If no config is specified, the plugin will not validate and abort, and not work.
    Ditto if there's an empty string (<message></message>).
    
    Remember to use <![CDATA[Your message]]> inside of the <message> tags if your message
    contains XML stuff.
    
    Rules for triggering the bot:
        - Message must contain at least one letter
        - All letters must be in all caps.  If not, the bot is not triggered.
        - The message must be at least 3 characters long.
