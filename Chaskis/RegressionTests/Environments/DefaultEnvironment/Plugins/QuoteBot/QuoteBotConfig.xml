Quote bot configuration:

addcommand - The command to add a quote.  
             Must be a regex that contains groups "user" and "quote".
             
deletecommand - The command to delete a quote from the database based on its ID. 
                Must be a regex that contains an "id" group.
                
randomcommand - The command to tell the bot to post a random quote from the database.

getcommand - The command used to get a quote with a specific ID from the database, and post it to the channel.
             Must be a regex that contains an "id" group.
             
Note: Notice for all the commands, there is a '^' in front.  This is important, otherwise a user can do
      "lololol !quote get 12" and the bot will parse that.  However, if you want that behavior, remove the '^'
      from the front.
