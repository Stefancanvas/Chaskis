    for Chaskis.
    
    For all the settings below, a missing or empty tag results
    in the default settings.
    
    logfilelocation - Where to store the log files.  Defaulted
                      to a Logs folder inside of 
                      the plugin directory (AppData/Chaskis/Plugins/IrcLogger/Logs).
                      
    maxnumbermessagesperlog - The number of messages from the channel to save in a single log file.
                              After this number of messages, the old log file will be closed, and a new
                              one will be opened.  Defaulted to 1000 messages.  Set to 0 for no limit.
                              

    logname - What to name the logs.  Defaulted to "irclog".  The log name will look like:
              logName.yyyy-MM-dd_HH-mm-ss-ff.log
              Note: The time stamp is the date of file create in UTC.
