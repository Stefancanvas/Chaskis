This is the configuration for the IsItDownBot.  This bot can detect if a website goes down.
You can either manually inspect websites using a command, or the bot can automatically check to see
if a website is down at an interval.

commandprefix - The command to use to manually query the status of ANY website.  For example, if this is set to
                '!isitdown', a user in a channel can use '!isitdown https://google.com' to see if google is up or not.
                This can not be an empty string.
                
websites - Websites to check to see if they are down automatically.
    url - The url to query.  If this URL does not return a success status, the bot will respond.  Can not be empty string.
    interval - the interval in MINUTES to check in on a website.  Must be 1 or greater.
    channel - The channels to send a message to if the website goes down.  Must be 1 or greater.  If no channels are specfied, a message
              gets sent to ALL channels the bot is in.
