    For all configuration options, unless otherwise specified, the following strings
    can be used for variable substitution:
    
    {%channel%} - Gets replaced with the channel the meeting took place in.
    {%meetingtopic%} - Gets replaced with the meeting topic.  The meeting topic is determined by the following:
                            - If the meeting topic is specified during #startmeeting, and #meetingtopic is never
                              used, then {%meetingtopic%} is replaced with the meeting topic set during #startmeeting.
                            - If #meetingtopic is specified, this gets replaced by the meeting topic specified
                              closest to the end of the meeting.
                              This means that using #meetingtopic and #save can write out multiple logs of different names
                              during the meeting if configured (in)correctly.
                            - If no meeting topic is specified, the default value, "Untitled Meeting" will be used.
    {%meetbotroot%} - Gets replaced to the absolute path to the MeetBot plugin configuration in the Chassis Root:  Chasis/Plugins/Meetbot.
                      Not valid in any filename options.
                      
    {%generatortype%} - The type of generator (e.g. xml, html, txt).

        If this is set to true, if at least 1 generator during a meeting fails to save its meeting notes,
        the default XML generator is run, and puts the meeting notes in a backup folder.
        
        The backup folder is located in {%meetbotroot%}/backups.
        
        The filename will be named {%channel%}-{%meetingtopic%}-{%timestamp%}.xml, where the timestamp is
        yyyy-MM-dd_HH-mm-ss-ffff, is UTC time, and has an invarient culture.
        
        The bot will report if this happens, and give the file name (but not the path) to the channel.

    <!--
        When a meeting is concluded or a save occurrs, the meeting notes can be generated in a variety of ways.
        Comment out or delete a generator to not generate meeting notes of that type.  If no generators
        are specified, then NO meeting notes will be generated, but MeetBot will otherwise function in the channel.
        
        You are also allowed to specify multiple generators of the same type.  Maybe you want to
        have one set of meeting notes whose headers are in English and one in Spanish?  However,
        be mindful of file name collisions; if multiple generators write out to the same file,
        one set of meeting notes will be overwritten.
        
        Generators have a few options:
        - type: An attribute on how to output the meeting notes.  You are allowed to specify multiple of the same type.
                An example of each is below.
        - channel: Which channel this generator is used for.  If not specified, the generator
                   will be used for all channels EXCEPT for any channel that is tied
                   to a specific channel.  You may specify more than one channel per generator.
        - templatepath: The path to the Razor template file to generate the meeting notes.  Not every
                        generator supports templates (such as XML), and will be ignored if specified.
                        If this is not specified, the default template of each type will be used.
                        The Razor Syntax is the one RazorLight (https://github.com/toddams/RazorLight) uses.
        - output: Where to output the meeting notes.  This value should be an absolute path.
                  It is defaulted to {%meetbotroot%}/notes/{%channel%}/ if not specified.
        - filename: When the meeting is saved, it will save the meeting notes as a text file.
                    If not specified, the filename will be named {%channel%}-{%meetingtopic%}-{%timestamp%}, where the timestamp is
                    yyyy-MM-dd_HH-mm-ss-ffff, is UTC time, and has an invarient culture.  The file extension will be the generator type.

                    The text file will be named by the following options:
                        - timestamp:  This is format string of the timestamp of when the meeting starts.
                                        
                                      This value is passed directly into C#'s DateTime.ToString() function.
                                      See this documentation for more information:
                                      https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.datetime.tostring?view=netcore-3.1.
                                      Default value if not specified is "yyyy-MM-dd_HH-mm-ss-ffff".
                                      
                                      The timestamp element contains an attribute in the form of a true or false
                                      if the timestamp of the timestamp should
                                      use UTC time (DateTime.UtcNow) or local time (DateTime.Now).  Default value if
                                      not specified is to use UTC.
                                       
                                      The timestamp element can also contain an attribute in the form of a culture string.
                                      Depending on the string passed into DateTime.ToString(), the output can change
                                      depending on the culture.  Leave this blank to default it to "Invariant Culture"
                                      (see: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.globalization.cultureinfo.invariantculture?view=netcore-3.1 ).
                                       
                                      The output of DateTime.ToString() will then be passed into the {%timestamp%}
                                      variable of the filename's "name" element.

                        - name:  What to call the file.  The file gets put into the output directory when
                                 the meeting is saved.  Any variable (minus {%meetbotroot%} is valid, but the recommended ones are
                                 {%meetingtopic%}, {%generatortype%} (for the extension), and {%timestamp%}.
                                 Note, ANY whitespace is replaced with '_'.
                                 
        - postsaveaction: After saving the meeting notes, this action is run directly on the command line, and can include
                          variables.  Variables can be {%fullfilepath%} for the absolute path including the file name of the file that was just
                          saved, or {%filename%} for the just the filename of the file that was just saved.
                    
                          An example use case could be setting the permissions to 644 via chmod or something.
                    
                          If this option is not specified, no action is taken.
                    
                          The bot will specify if the option was successful or not in the channel.
                    
        - postsavemsg: When the meeting notes are saved, the bot will send this out to the channel for each generator.
                       Perhaps you copied the files to an HTTP server and want to tell people where to find them?
                       {%filename%} is a useful variable here.
                       
                       If not specified, the bot will still acknowledge if the meeting notes got saved or not.
                       
                       The postsavemsg will not fire if the postsave action failed.
