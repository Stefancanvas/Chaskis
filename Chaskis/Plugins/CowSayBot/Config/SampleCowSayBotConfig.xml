    Cow say bot config.
    
    command:  The regex that will trigger cowsay bot to respond.
              Defaulted to ^!{%saycmd&} (?<msg>.+).  Best leave this alone unless yo know regexes.
              MUST have the (?<msg>.+) group somewhere in it or the plugin will fail validation.
              {%saycmd%} is replaced by the cowfile command before the regex is created.
              For example, if you have the vader cowfile whose command is vadersay,
              "!vadersay something" will trigger the bot to respond with "something" in the bubble.
              Regex will also accept {%channel%} for the current channel name and {%nick%} for the bots nick name.
    
    path:     Path to the cowsay executable. Defaulted to /usr/bin/cowsay.  The plugin will fail validation
              unless cowsay exists on the specfied path.
    
    cowfile:  Cowsay supports many shapes that can appear.  These are called cowfiles.  You
              can get a list of all the cowfiles your install of cowsay supports by doing "cowsay -l" on
              the command line.  DEFAULT is a special config, which just sends "cowsay yourMessage" and
              specifies no cowfile.
              Note that during plugin validation, each of these commands will be run on the command line and ensure
              cowsay returns 0 in order for the plugin to be validated.
              
              The cowfile's name is what gets passed to the -f on the cowsay command line.  The exception is
              DEFAULT, which just runs cowsay with no -f specified.  The command is the string the bot is looking
              for in {%saycmd%}.
