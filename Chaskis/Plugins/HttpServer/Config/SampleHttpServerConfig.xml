This plugin allows a user to send an HTTP request to the bot in order to perform
actions on the channel.

 - Port: Which port to open to accept HTTP requests from.  It is discouraged to put a port
         that is open outside of your PC, unless you trust everyone on your network.
         DO NOT put this on a port that is exposed to the internet, unless you want strangers
         controlling your bot.
