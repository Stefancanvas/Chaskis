<!--
This plugin sends a message to all the channels the bot is a member
of when it first joins the channel if the bot's version changed.

- Message: The message to send.  Must be at least 1 character and not all whitespace.  {%version%} is replaced with the Chaskis version.

- Delay: The time in seconds to wait after first connecting to the IRC Server (NOT THE CHANNEL)
         before sending the message.
