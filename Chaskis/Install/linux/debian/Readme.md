Installing for Debian/Ubuntu
========

Chaskis runs with Mono.  Debian and Ubuntu come with woefully out-of-date versions of Mono.

Follow the instructions on Mono's site to show how to get the latest version of Mono: [http://www.mono-project.com/download/#download-lin](http://www.mono-project.com/download/#download-lin)

Then simply run CreateDeb.sh in this directory.  ```chaskis.deb``` will be created. You can install chaskis using the command ```dpkg -i chaskis.deb```
